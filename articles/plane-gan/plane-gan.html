    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This custom-made GAN is trained to generate images of planes.
        It was built in TensorFlow and trained on my GPU. The results are recognizable as aircraft!</p>

    <h2>Training</h2>

    <p>
        It is trained on dataset of about 10,000 images of planes.
        Training was done on a 1650 Super GPU and took about 1.5 hours to run 128 epochs.

    <h2>Model Architecture</h2>

    <p>
        The full code can be seen in the GitHub page linked at the corner of the screen. This includes generator and
        discriminator summaries.
    </p>

    <p>

        The discriminator had 4,316,673 trainable parameters while the generator had 1,951,559, combining for a total of
        6,270,152 parameters.
    </p>


    <p>

        The discriminator made heavy use of Conv2D layers to progressively downsample to a final dense layer. Batch
        normalization and LeakyReLU
        supported each of these conv2d layers until the tensor could be flattened (with some dropout).
    </p>


    <p>

        The generator worked very much in the opposite direction, upscaling with Conv2DTranspose layers. LeakyReLU was
        again used as the activation function.
        The generator upscaled all the way back to the desired (64,64,3) shape, which was the size of both the training
        images and discriminator input.

    </p>


    <h2>Latent Space Sweep</h2>

    <p>After training, I generated a sweep over the latent space and recorded the generator output in a gif.</p>

    <p>
        Notice how the tail fin of the plane switches directions during the sweep.
         This accurately reflects the dataset used as it contained images of planes in either direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        The sweep was performed by applying a normal distribution of deltas to each of the 100 latent space elements.
    </p>
