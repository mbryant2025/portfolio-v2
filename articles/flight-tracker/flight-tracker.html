    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
        Flight Tracker is a web application that allows users to track flights in real time. It is built using a ground
        plane antenna, an SDR, and a Raspberry Pi.
        Data is decoded using Dump1090 and is displayed on a custom web page hosted by the Pi.

    <h2>Build Process</h2>

    <p>
        This project started with the antenna. I decided to build a ground plane antenna that would be able to receive
        1090 MHz ADS-B signals from overhead aircraft.
        The antenna is made from a flattened copper pipe and 1/4 wavelength coax center conductors.

    <p>Completed antenna. An F connector was used to easily interface with the ground plane, radiating element, and coax
        cable.</p>

    <p>
        Next came interfacing with the antenna through software. I used a Raspberry Pi 3B and an RTL-SDR dongle to
        digitize the signals.
        I configured Dump1090 to work on the Pi and made a backend Python script to read from Dump1090 and generate HTML
        using Pydeck.
        This HTML and the raw JSON is then served using NGINX through port forwarding. The final rendering takes the
        form of an iframe on the web interface. The entire software stack runs from boot on the Pi.
    </p>

    <p>
        The interface gets updates approximately every five seconds and they are reflected seamlessly and interactively
        on the web page.
        The backend also keeps track of various all-time records such as the highest altitude and the greatest speed.

    <p>
        The colors of the paths also have meaning. Planes with blue paths are higher while planes with white paths are
        lower.
        Additionally, planes with green paths are are record planes as indicated by the Record Book on the page.

        I then tested the entire system by going outside and holding the antenna over my head (confusing my neighbors in
        the process).
        I was able to see aircraft both overhead and on the web page. I decided I would make a more permanent setup.

    <p>
        With the deformation of the 3D print, I began to get concerned about the thermal performance of the Pi and SDR.
        I mounted the Pi in a fan case and proceeded to mount a CPU cooler to the SDR.

    <h2>Web Viewer</h2>

    <p>The server is no longer running, but I created a static render of what the application looked like (desktop only).
        Note that the planes would move in real-time when the system was running!</p>
