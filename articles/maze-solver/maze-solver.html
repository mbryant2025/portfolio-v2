    <h2>Features</h2>

    <p>The algorithm solves using A* and is implemented in TypeScript. The GUI is implemented in React.
        You can update the walls, start, and end point, and the algorithm will automatically re-solve the maze.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bonus features include enabling/disabling diagonal movement,
        clicking and dragging to draw walls, a template maze, and a button to clear the maze.

    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
        This project was initially implemented in Python with a GUI made in Tkinter in 2021. With the intent of embedding it into this website, I decided to re-implement it in TypeScript in 2023.

    <p>Also, if it wasn't evident from the screenshot, the old version was not perfect! Upon re-implementing I was sure to remove these bugs.</p>
