    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Made for HackDuke2023, PatientWatch is a patient monitoring system.
        It is a modular system that is currently fitted for tracking patient temperature, room humidity, and patient
        movement.

        The system works over the internet, and is designed to be used in a hospital setting. During the Hackathon,
        we streamed data from accross campus and we won first place.

    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>
        Web hosting is made possible through a Flask server. The software was made for a Raspberry Pi, but can also be run on a PC.
        For the case of a PC, an Arduino is used to collect data from sensors and send it to the PC, with use of the PySerial library.

        A webcam is attached to the computer where a simple OpenCV algorithm is used to detect movement.
