    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This system turns the UR5e robot arm into a 3D printer in Gazebo. It consists of three parts: a custom slicer profile for the UR5e,
        a G-code interpreter that sends commands to the robot, and a Gazebo plugin that simulates the extruder.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>
        For the purpose of this project, many of the different G-code commands were ignored. Specifically, the only parts considered were the G0 and G1 commands.
        These commands are used to move the robot to a specific location. The G0 command is used for non-extruding moves, while the G1 command is used for extruding moves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Built into the G-code interpreter is an interface for enabling and disabling the extruder. This allowed for the important abstraction between the separate parts of the system.
        The G-code parser also had some useful optimizations and abstractions. It made use of a Python generator to allow for the G-code to be read line-by-line, rather than all at once. This was also abstracted from any ROS or Gazebo specific code, allowing for the G-code interpreter to be tested individually.

    <h2>Notes about Simulation</h2>

    <p>Since the robot is printing in simulation, there are a few extra considerations.</p>

    <p>
        There is no need for support material, since the robot can print in mid-air. Additionally, the layer height was made to be very large (5mm) to speed up printing and to make the layers more visible.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, the simulation speed decreases as the robot prints. This is because of a suspected memory leak in the Gazebo plugin that we modified.
    </p>


    <h2>Role</h2>

    <p>Made by a group of four students for Duke ECE 383: Intro to Robotics and Automation, my role was the core of the system: the G-code interpreter and 
        sending commands to the robot (both movement and the extruder). </p>
