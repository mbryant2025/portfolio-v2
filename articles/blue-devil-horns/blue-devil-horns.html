    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Blue Devil horns are common at Duke Basketball games. However, they are only static. I decided I would modify them to have
        network-controlled animations.

    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>
        I used an Arduino Nano 33 IoT to both control the horns and connect to a network. The horns are controlled by a netcat command.

        Putting the horns on the Duke WiFi network is not necessairly simple, so I brought my own router to college. Not sure if this is technically allowed on campus...

    </p>

    <p>
        For the command, I simply send a single byte to the Arduino. The byte is the index of the animation to play. This can be expanded in the future.

     <p>
        I also acknowledge the current command only sends to one IP. Another improvement would be to have a central server that all horns could connect to. This would allow for more complex animations and more horns.
